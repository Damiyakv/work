							<p>I have been working under the Economics Chair at University of Michigan, Professor Melvin Stephens since June 2021. I use ArcGIS to digitize maps. As a member of the research group, I help troubleshoot problems with the project, summarize & discuss papers in meetings, and help in analysing the effect of education policies in US in the 1960s.</p>
							<p>I work as an Arts reviewer for University of Michigan's Arts programme. I visit events like cultural dances, theatre performances, planetarium shows, book signings, indie fairs, and just about all events that promote arts. I write aobut my experience on the university arts blog. So far I have published 20 pieces.</p>
							<p> I am a creative fiction writer and have a minor in creative writing. I have written micro fiction and short stories. When I edit documentaries, my background in story telling helps me structure the video narrative in a natural non obtrusive way. I have also taken classes on screen writing and have written several short scripts ranging from 5 to 10 pages. 
							</p>
							<p>I love learning new things about culture, different countries, customs, history and more. I have taken classes on Iranian Cinema, Relationships in Japanese Culture, Archaeology, Witchcraft in Melanesia etc. All these amazing classes have expanded my worldview. While writing my research papers for these classes I honed the essential skill of discussing new ideas in a convincing way. 
							</p>
							<p>I also make video essays about history and culture. My lastest one is about Why People Wear Bindis. Everytime I make a new video essay I learn more about how to make information entertaining. It fits in with my goal of making academic communication accessible and fun!
